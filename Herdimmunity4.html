 <h3>How covid virus is different from others</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
  and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). So what makes those coronaviruses different from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?  Dr. Clayton Cowl, a pulmonologist 
  and chair of Mayo Clinic's Division of Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, says that SARS-CoV-2 shares both similarities and differences with other coronaviruses.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name 'coronavirus' has to do with what the virus looks like under a microscope," says Dr. Cowl. "'Corona' means crown.
  All coronaviruses have a similar structure. They are also 'enveloped' viruses, which means they are able to stick to surfaces,
  but are also able to be killed with disinfectants. The novel virus that causes COVID-19 is one-nine hundredth of a width of a piece of hair." </p>

<h4>Why is the virus that causes COVID-19 is novel?</h4>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The virus is called 'novel' because it started with an animal population, was transmitted to a human and now can go from human to human.
 Our immune systems have never seen this particular strain of virus before, so we haven't developed immunity. We don't have a vaccine for it at this point. And similar to many of the other novel viruses, it has potential for worldwide distribution.
 We've seen this with the Middle East virus (MERS), with SARS and other viruses that we've heard about over time."</p>

 <h4>Is COVID-19 more contagious that other coronaviruses?</h4>

   <p>Dr. Cowl says that SARS-CoV-2 is likely more contagious than the viruses that cause influenza and common cold because it is new to humans. Humans have no way to prepare for it, and their immune systems are not ready to fight it. This results in the virus causing more cellular damage and producing more inflammatory cells.
   For people with decreased immunity, due to medications, a specific condition, or from aging, the resulting COVID-19 disease is more serious.</p>
