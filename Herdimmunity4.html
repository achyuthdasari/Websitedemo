 <h3>How covid virus is different from others</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
  and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). So what makes those coronaviruses different from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?  Dr. Clayton Cowl, a pulmonologist 
  and chair of Mayo Clinic's Division of Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, says that SARS-CoV-2 shares both similarities and differences with other coronaviruses.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name 'coronavirus' has to do with what the virus looks like under a microscope," says Dr. Cowl. "'Corona' means crown.
  All coronaviruses have a similar structure. They are also 'enveloped' viruses, which means they are able to stick to surfaces,
  but are also able to be killed with disinfectants. The novel virus that causes COVID-19 is one-nine hundredth of a width of a piece of hair." </p>
