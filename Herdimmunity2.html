 <h4>Will COVID-19 become a seasonal problem like the flu?</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Cowl says there is a lot not yet know about COVID-19, and how it will act in the future is uncertain.
  It's too early to know if it will evaporate like H1N1 or SARS, or remain at a low level for years.
   He says the focus now is to minimize the spread of the virus and to help patients who have it.</p>
 
   <h4>How can the spread of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses be prevented?</h4>
 
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses can be prevented by taking these steps:</p>
